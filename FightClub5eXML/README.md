# README


## About

We have been a dedicated group of D&D fans who manually added XML for Lion's Den Fight Club 5e and Game Master 5e apps. We've now found a reliable source to auto-generate the XML, and have transitioned to that as of November 2020. If you have feedback, follow the instructions in [Issues](#Issues).

We are unaffiliated with Lion's Den and Wizards of the Coast.


## How-To

Import only one of the Collection files into the Fight Club app.

**Everything**: Newly formatted XML that includes all rulebooks, supplements, adventures, Unearthed Arcana, and some miscellaneous and unofficial content, like Plane Shift and Adventurers League.

**CoreRulebooks**: Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual

**CoreRulebooksAndSupplements**: _CoreRulebooks_ plus Rulebook Supplements (XGtE, MToF, VGtM, SCAG, GGtR, WGtE, ERftLW, AI, EGtW, MFF, Tortle Package, One Grung Above, MOoT)

**CoreOnly**: _CoreRulebooksAndSupplements_ plus Adventures

**CorePlusHomebrew-NoUA**: _CoreOnly_ plus homebrew, which includes the Blood Hunter class and Gunslinger subclass for Fighter

**CorePlusUnreleasedUA**: _CoreOnly_ plus unreleased Unearthed Arcana

**CorePlusUA-NoHomebrew**: _CoreOnly_ plus all Unearthed Arcana

**Complete**: _CorePlusUA-NoHomebrew_ plus homebrew and third party content
